```

### Save the set of certificates as a secret

```
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash -c 'DOMAINS=example.com foo.example.com ./save_certs.sh'
```

### Refresh the certificates

```
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash -c 'EMAIL=fred@fred.com DOMAINS=example.com foo.example.com SECRET_NAME=foo DEPLOYMENTS=bar ./refresh_certs.sh'
